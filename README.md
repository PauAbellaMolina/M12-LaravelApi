# Ã€nimaLocal API

Grow the economy of a city by gamifying and encouraging people to buy from the local commerces in exchange of points and level.  
These will be changed into recompenses and give a sense of prestige respectively.  

This API will be consume by both [user](https://github.com/PauAbellaMolina/M12-IonicFront) and [commerce](https://github.com/PauAbellaMolina/M12-CommerceFront) apps to read and write data into a MySQL DB, amongst other stuff.

This was my CertHE final project.  
A Laravel project with just the API side in use.
